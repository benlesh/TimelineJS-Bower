TimelineJS-Bower
================

Simply creating a Bower package for TimelineJS for the authors who didn't want to maintain one. 

Bower Usage:

```sh
bower install timeline
```

All information and documentation can be found on the [TimelineJS GitHub Repository](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/TimelineJS) and/or the [Timeline JS Website](http://timeline.knightlab.com).

There's no "dev standards" for this repo. All this is is just "copy pasta" of the important directories and licensing information from their repository. If they decide they want to maintain the "timeline" name in Bower, I'll gladly hand it over. Right now, I have it as a dependency in a project, and I wanted it in Bower.
